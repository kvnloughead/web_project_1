<!-- Notes for project 2 -->

# Issues with brief
1. Header
    - We are told to rotate the square-pic by 15deg counter-clockwise.  Doing so doesn't match the image in the brief.  I used -38deg.

2. Techniques
    - The image corresponding to the Interleaving card is inconsistently named interliving

3. Kaufman

    - The triangle was problematic in the last project:  the settings giving really don't seem to fit with the picture.  Rotating helps (but it is still not right) and shifted positionally.   But now the triangle is rotated _differently_ and positioned differently on the page, with no explanation that I could find.
